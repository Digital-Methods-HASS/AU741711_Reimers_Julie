# Task 1: Create a Danish equivalent of AUSmap with esri layers, 
# but call it DANmap

########## ADD DATA TO LEAFLET

# In this section you will manually create machine-readable spatial
# data from GoogleMaps: 

### First, go to https://bit.ly/CreateCoordinates1
### Enter the coordinates of your favorite leisure places in Denmark 
# extracting them from the URL in googlemaps, adding name and type of monument.
# Remember to copy the coordinates as a string, as just two decimal numbers separated by comma. 

# Caveats: Do NOT edit the grey columns! They populate automatically!

### Second, read the sheet into R. You will need gmail login information. 
# watch the console, it may ask you to authenticate or put in the number 
# that corresponds to the account you wish to use.

# Libraries

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(googlesheets4)
library(leaflet)
```


# Read in a Google sheet
```{r}
places <- read_sheet("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PlxsPElZML8LZKyXbqdAYeQCDIvDps2McZx1cTVWSzI/edit#gid=124710918",
                     col_types = "cccnncnc",
                     range="DM2023")
glimpse(places)

```


# load the coordinates in the map and check: are any points missing? Why?
```{r}
DANmap <- leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addProviderTiles("Stadia.StamenWatercolor") %>% 
  addMarkers(lng = places$Longitude, 
             lat = places$Latitude,
             popup = places$Description)
DANmap
```

# Task 2: Read in the googlesheet data you and your colleagues 
# populated with data into the DANmap object you created in Task 1.
```{r}
DANmap
```


# Task 3: Can you cluster the points in Leaflet? Google "clustering options in Leaflet"
```{r}
DANmap_clusters <- leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addProviderTiles("Stadia.StamenWatercolor") %>% 
  addMarkers(lng = places$Longitude, 
             lat = places$Latitude,
             popup = places$Description,
             clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions())
DANmap_clusters
```


# Task 4: Look at the map and consider what it is good for and what not.
```{r}
# It is good for showing how we as a class in Aarhus think there are many good places. But it is difficult without zooming in to se where exactly the thinks are located. 

```


# Task 5: Find out how to display notes and classifications in the map.
```{r}
DANmap_notes <- leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addProviderTiles("Stadia.StamenWatercolor") %>% 
  addMarkers(lng = places$Longitude, 
             lat = places$Latitude,
             popup=paste(
               "By:", places$Placename, "<br>",
               "Type:", places$Type, "<br>",
               "Description:", places$Description),
             clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions())
